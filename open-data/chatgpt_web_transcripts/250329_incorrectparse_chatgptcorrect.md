This is a very interesting and rich sentence to parse:  
**"I really can not even believe some of this content right now."**

Let's walk through what the parser is doing and evaluate whether it's *syntactically accurate* as a dependency parse.

### 🧠 Breakdown of the Parse:
**Main verb/root**: `believe` (✓ good choice)

**Subject**:  
- `i` → **nsubj** of `believe` (✓ correct)

**Modals/auxiliaries/negation/adverbs**:  
- `can` → **aux** of `believe` (✓)
- `not` → **neg** of `believe` (✓)
- `even` → **advmod** of `not` (✓ – makes sense for "not even")
- `really` → **advmod** of `believe` (✓ – good)
- `right` and `now` → both **advmod** of `believe` (✓ – "right now" modifying the verb)

**Object**:  
- `some` → **dobj** of `believe` ❗*questionable*
- `of` → **prep** attached to `some` ❗*but this seems off*
- `this` → **det** of `content` (✓)
- `content` → **pobj** of `of` (✓)
- `this content` → a prepositional object within a partitive structure: **"some of this content"**

---

### 🚨 Issues:
The main **error** in this parse is:

#### ❌ `some` as **dobj** of `believe`
- In this phrase, **"some of this content"** is a partitive construction.
- The **head noun** is **"content"**, not "some".
- The correct parse would make `content` the **dobj** (direct object) of `believe`.
- `some` should be a **quantifier** (possibly `nummod` or `det`) modifying `content`, not a pronoun.
- This seems to come from the parser treating "some" as a standalone pronoun, which would be correct in "I believe some", but not here.

---

### ✅ Everything else looks quite good:
- Adverbs are well-scoped and attached to the right verb.
- Negation and modality are parsed in a way consistent with modern dependency guidelines (e.g., Universal Dependencies).
- The noun phrase “this content” is properly nested under the preposition "of", which is good.

---

### ✅ Suggested Correction:
A more accurate parse might have:
- `content` as **dobj** of `believe`
- `some` as `det` or `nummod` on `content`
- `of` as `case` (if using Universal Dependencies v2), or as a function word depending on your parsing scheme

---

### 💬 Summary:
**Mostly correct**, but:

> ❗ "some" should not be the direct object — "content" should.

This is a classic issue in parsing partitive noun phrases, and not uncommon even in state-of-the-art parsers.

Let me know if you want to explore how different parsers (like spaCy vs. Stanza vs. Berkeley Neural Parser) would handle this one.
