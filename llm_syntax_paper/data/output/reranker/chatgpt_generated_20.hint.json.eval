Nice — this is really insightful data! Let's evaluate **how well ChatGPT performed** given the focused prompt and the gold labels.

I'll go line by line, check:

- If ChatGPT said **"yes"** and the gold label says the prediction is correct ✅.
- If ChatGPT said **"no"** and it agrees with the gold label that it's incorrect ❌.
- Or if there’s a **mismatch**, which is the most interesting.

|--:|------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | telescope attached to **saw** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Correct and aligned |
| 2 | tray with **served** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Correct |
| 3 | umbrella → **girl**, GPT said **admired** is wrong | ❌ | No | ✅ | GPT caught the error |
| 4 | jacket → **actor**, GPT said "Yes" | ❌ | ❌ | GPT missed this one |
| 5 | cave → **sample**, GPT said "No" | ❌ | ✅ | GPT caught the error |
| 6 | smile → **greeted** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Good |
| 7 | Paris → **artist** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Good |
| 8 | rooftop → **shot** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Good |
| 9 | blue flowers → **vase**, GPT said "Yes" (predicted head = painted) | ❌ | ❌ | GPT missed this |
| 10 | oven → **cooked** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Correct |
| 11 | red feathers → **bird**, GPT said "No" | ❌ | ✅ | GPT caught error |
| 12 | alley → **arrested** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Correct |
| 13 | broken arm → **statue**, GPT said "No" | ❌ | ✅ | Correct error detection |
| 14 | strawberries → **decorated** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Good |
| 15 | binoculars → **watched** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Good |
| 16 | fountain → **park**, GPT said "No" | ❌ | ✅ | GPT caught error |
| 17 | dirty hands → **child**, GPT said "Yes" | ❌ | ❌ | GPT missed the error |
| 18 | garage → **fixed** | ✅ | Yes | ✅ | Good |
| 19 | torn cover → **couch**, GPT said "No" | ❌ | ✅ | Caught the error |
| 20 | cracked windows → **building**, GPT said "Yes" | ❌ | ❌ | Missed this one |

### 📊 Summary

- ✅ **Correctly judged** (agreement with gold label): **16/20**
- ❌ **Incorrect judgments** (missed or wrong): **4/20**
  - Missed: #4, #9, #17, #20

---

### 🔎 Observations

- GPT was **very strong at catching obvious noun-modifier mistakes** (e.g., #3, #11, #13).
- It **struggled when the sentence was ambiguous** or when the parser and prompt interpretation diverged (e.g., #9: *painted the vase with the blue flowers*).
- It sometimes **gave a wrong "yes"** even when its own parser attached the phrase incorrectly (#4, #17, #20).

### ✅ Suggestions to Improve Accuracy

1. **Include the predicted attachment in the prompt** — e.g.:
   > "According to the parse, the phrase 'with the telescope' is attached to 'saw'. Is this correct?"

   This makes it explicit what ChatGPT is supposed to evaluate, rather than relying on it to infer it from CoNLL.

2. **Ask for binary response first**, like:
   > "Answer 'yes' or 'no' first, then explain if 'no'."

3. **Use token numbers or highlight the phrase span** — this reduces ambiguity if multiple similar words are in the sentence.

Would you like a version of your script that adds the explicit predicted head word to the prompt (as in suggestion 1)?
