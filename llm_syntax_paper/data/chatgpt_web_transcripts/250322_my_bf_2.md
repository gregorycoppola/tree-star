in the sentence inside the triple quotes """ girls will get a bf and then start every tweet to her friends with “my bf” """... which verb or noun does "to her friends" modify?

Nice follow-up! In the sentence:

> **"girls will get a bf and then start every tweet to her friends with 'my bf'"**

the prepositional phrase **"to her friends"** most naturally modifies **"tweet"** — not the verb **"start"**.

Let’s unpack it:

- **"start every tweet"** → core verb + object.
- **"to her friends"** → specifies **the intended recipients** of the tweet, so it tells us *who the tweet is directed to*.
- **"with 'my bf'"** → tells us *how the tweet is started*, so it modifies **"start"**.

So:

- **"to her friends"** modifies **"tweet"** (it’s describing *the target audience of the tweet*).
- **"with 'my bf'"** modifies **"start"** (describing *how* the tweet is begun).

In summary:
- **"to her friends" → modifies → "tweet"**
- **"with 'my bf'" → modifies → "start"**
