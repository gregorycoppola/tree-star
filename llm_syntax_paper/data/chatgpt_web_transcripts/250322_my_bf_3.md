can YOU come up with an example to test this kind of syntactic ambiguity?

Absolutely! Here's an example sentence that plays on **syntactic ambiguity** in a similar way:

> **"He began every message to his boss with a joke."**

This sentence is clear, but it's **ambiguous** in structure if we tweak it a little:

> **"He began emailing every message to his boss with a joke."**

Now we can ask:  
Does **"to his boss"** modify:

1. **"message"** (i.e., the messages are *for* his boss)?  
2. Or **"emailing"** (i.e., he is *emailing* to his boss, maybe forwarding messages)?

### Why this works:
- "every message to his boss" → could mean *the messages are addressed to his boss*.
- Or, "emailing ... to his boss" → could mean *he is sending the messages to his boss*.

### Another fun example:
> **"She sent every photo of her dog to her friend with a funny caption."**

Now we have **two potential attachments**:
- "to her friend" could go with "sent" (she sent to her friend).
- "with a funny caption" could go with:
  - "photo" (the photo has a caption)
  - or "sent" (she added a caption in the message)

So depending on how you group the prepositional phrases, you can create layered ambiguities.
