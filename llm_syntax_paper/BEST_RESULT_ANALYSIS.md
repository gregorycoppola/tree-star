Great instinct to scrutinize the evaluation script — especially when a model is performing *surprisingly well*. Let's walk through your script and consider whether there's any **unintentional "cheating"**, **leakage**, or **overestimation** of accuracy.

---

## ✅ What the Script *Does* Well

- Cleanly loads the examples and processes them one by one.
- Makes real API calls in live mode.
- Uses `.lower()` to normalize expected and predicted heads.
- Only considers a result `correct` if there's an exact string match.
- Logs outputs transparently.
- Avoids leaking gold labels into the prompt.

✅ These are all **good signs**. But let's dig for **possible hidden flaws**.

---

## 🔍 Potential Issues or “Cheating” Scenarios

### ❗1. **Is the gold head word present in the ambiguous phrase?**
Example:
```json
{
  "sentence": "The woman hugged the child with the stuffed animal.",
  "ambiguous_phrase": "with the stuffed animal",
  "correct_attachment": "child"
}
```

If GPT were using only substring matching heuristics (e.g., proximity or NER-type reasoning), and if the gold head ("child") appeared **inside** or **adjacent to** the ambiguous phrase or its modifiers, that could make the task easier than a real dependency parse.

✅ But in your examples, the `correct_attachment` is **not** in the ambiguous phrase, so this looks okay.

---

### ❗2. **Is the prompt language biasing the model toward gold answers?**

Prompt:
```text
In the sentence: "{sentence}"
What word does the phrase "{phrase}" attach to syntactically?
Return only the head word.
```

This is solid. But a few thoughts:

- Because you say *"What word..."* without specifying the **type of parse** (dependency vs. constituent), GPT may fall back to **common sense or semantic heuristics**.
- Since you say "attach to syntactically", GPT **should** lean toward dependency structure — but it’s still possible GPT is just using prior knowledge of what's typically the head in such sentences (e.g. "examined" is likely the verb controlling "with the magnifying glass").

💡 **Mitigation:** You already added a `system` message:  
> *You are a linguist helping analyze syntactic attachments.*

You could tighten this further to:
```python
"You are a linguist analyzing English dependency parses. For each example, identify the one word in the sentence that serves as the syntactic head (governor) of the given prepositional phrase."
```

---

### ❗3. **Does the postprocessing assume a one-word answer, even when GPT is verbose?**

Current logic:
```python
answer = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
return answer.split()[0].lower()
```

If GPT says:
```
The phrase attaches to the verb "examined".
```

This will extract `"the"` — which would be **wrong**, but still evaluated as `"the" == expected_head` — only if the gold is `"the"`, which is unlikely.

🧠 So this is **not overestimating**, but:
- It might **underestimate** performance if GPT is verbose.
- Or **lead to unpredictable false negatives**.

✅ So you're not cheating here, but to be safe, improve this line:

```python
import re

def extract_head_word(text: str) -> str:
    match = re.search(r'\b([a-zA-Z-]+)\b', text)
    return match.group(1).lower() if match else None
```

Then use:
```python
return extract_head_word(answer)
```

---

### ⚠️ 4. **Possible Label Leakage (unlikely but worth checking)**

The function `evaluate_example()` is safe: it only uses the sentence and ambiguous phrase. No leakage from `correct_attachment` into the prompt.

✅ You're not passing the gold label to GPT — good.

---

### ⚠️ 5. **Are sentences too “obvious”?**

This isn’t about cheating in the code, but in the **dataset design**. If the sentences are semantically obvious — like:

> "He cut the bread with the serrated knife."  
→ It’s nearly impossible to interpret "with the serrated knife" as modifying "bread"

...then GPT might be getting high scores because the disambiguation is *semantic*, not syntactic.

✅ You already mix in harder ones like:
> "She hugged the child with the stuffed animal."  
→ this is much more ambiguous.

But it's worth asking: is the dataset **well balanced** between:
- Verb-attached vs. noun-attached PPs?
- Reversible interpretations?

📊 You could break down accuracy by these types to get better insights.

---

## ✅ Summary of Recommendations

1. **Improve postprocessing** to extract a true content word from GPT's response (avoid `.split()[0]`).
2. **Tighten the system prompt** to emphasize dependency parsing and make task clearer.
3. **Audit sentence design** — ensure you have enough truly ambiguous cases.
4. **Add breakdowns** in your eval script:
   - How many were verb-attached vs noun-attached?
   - Accuracy by type?

---

Let me know if you want help:
- Generating adversarial / ambiguous examples
- Doing per-category breakdowns
- Comparing against a baseline parser like Stanza or spaCy

You're very close to a clean, reproducible eval pipeline — just a few tweaks will make it ironclad.
