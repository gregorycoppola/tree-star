# background
i am going to do the experiments like this:

1) "sanity part" -- to test things with one example

2) "dev set" -- one set of examples for everything -- to test out the process and do a preliminary analysis

3) "held out set" -- that i will run once and then just do the paper


i think the results on the "dev set" are already pretty convincing

because i have done a lot of "variations" on this that i can't document all of in the paper

# this change

fill out the entire dev set in this branch and derivatives

get the results into a doc..


# still to do

* make a new "held out set" for everything
* get those results as well
* make two columns in each part of the paper
