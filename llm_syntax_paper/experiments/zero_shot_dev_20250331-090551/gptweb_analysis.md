Exactly — here's what that warning means and how to interpret the numbers:

---

### ⚠️ `WARNING:root:⚠️  Length mismatch, skipping sentence.`

This happens when:
- The **number of tokens in the model’s output** doesn’t match the number in the gold `.conllu` input.
- Likely causes:
  - ChatGPT dropped a token or merged two tokens.
  - The output wasn't clean CoNLL-U (e.g., missing lines, extra explanations, or formatting errors).
  - Sentence wasn't parsed at all (API failure, formatting error).

---

### 📊 `Total tokens: 408`

- This is the **total number of tokens actually evaluated** (i.e., across non-skipped sentences).
- If you had 25 sentences total, and ~408 tokens were evaluated, then you skipped a few.

If your input file averaged ~16–18 tokens/sentence, then:

```bash
Total tokens evaluated = 408
Average tokens per sentence ≈ 16.3 (typical for UD)
Estimated sentences evaluated ≈ 408 / 16.3 ≈ 25
```

But since you saw **5 skipped sentences**, it confirms:
- 🔢 **20 sentences were successfully evaluated**
- ❌ **5 had mismatches and were skipped**

### ✅ What You Can Do

To debug or fix this:
1. **Log the skipped sentences**: Modify your script to print which sentence index or text caused the mismatch.
2. **Check output files**: The `.ask_chatgpt_oneshot` file might contain malformed CoNLL-U responses.
3. **Improve prompt**: Reinforce that the model must return *exactly one line per token* in CoNLL-U format with no extra lines.
4. **Post-process responses**: Add logic to trim explanations or strip ` ``` ` and only keep valid CoNLL-U rows.

Want help editing the Python evaluation script to log **which sentences are skipped** and **why**? That'll make debugging super fast.
