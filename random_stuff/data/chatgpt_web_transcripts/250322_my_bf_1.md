in the sentence inside the triple quotes """ girls will get a bf and then start every tweet with “my bf” """... which verb or noun does "with my bf" modify?

Great question! In the sentence:

> **"girls will get a bf and then start every tweet with 'my bf'"**

the prepositional phrase **"with 'my bf'"** modifies the verb **"start"**.

Let’s break it down:

- **Main structure:** *girls will get a bf* (first action) *and then start every tweet with "my bf"* (second action)
- **Verb:** *start* (as in "start a tweet")
- **Object of the verb:** *every tweet*
- **Prepositional phrase:** *with "my bf"*, which tells us **how** or **in what manner** the tweet is started.

So, **"with 'my bf'"** is describing **how** they start the tweet — it’s modifying the verb **"start"**, not "tweet" or "girls" or "bf."

Does that make sense?
